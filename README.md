Term project

Use Hadoop and Spark to implement a movie recommendation model with 10M stable benchmark rating dataset
Data from MovieLens
1. Local Machine

use python

how to run:

    python userFC.py ../../ml-100k/u.data ../../ml-100k/u.item

The above method use cos distance to calculate similarity and use user-based model, but in order to compared with the distributed version that use concurrency matrix as similarity and item-based model, we rewrite the version as itemCF.py. To run it:

    python itemCF.py ./ml-100k/u.data ./ml-100k/u.item ./ml-100k/u.user

2. MapReduce Version

use mahout
2.1 how to use maven

maven toturial
2.2 mahout in maven

mahout toturial
3. Spark Version
3.1. About the deployment of the maven for scalar

all the dependency can be found here: dependency. Be care about the version. If it is incorrect, there will be error.

for the pom.xml In order to use spark, you should include dependency of scala-library, spark-core and spark-mllib. In order to include all the dependency in the jar file you should add:

<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <descriptorRefs>
            <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
        </descriptorRefs>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>make-assembly</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>single</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>

3.2. run on local machine

We use spark-submit to run it, so we don't have to use the jar with dependency.

    ~/spark-1.6.0/bin/spark-submit --class MovieLensALS target/guo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

you can know what is inside a jar package with the command

    jar -tf XXXX.jar

3.3. run on AWS EMR

you can choose to add a step or login into the master node and use spark-submit.
